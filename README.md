# Blackbaud SKY API Authorization Code Flow Tutorial

Blackbaud SKY API Authorization Code Flow demo application.

## About

The Blackbaud SKY API currently supports the [Authorization Code Flow](https://apidocs.nxt.blackbaud-dev.com/docs/authorization/), which requires a back-end server component to securely store the client secret.  For this code sample, we've implemented the server component using NodeJS.  

We've stripped down the user interface to highlight the Authorization Code Flow.  Our [Barkbaud code samples](https://apidocs.nxt.blackbaud-dev.com/docs/code/) provide a rich user interface using [SKY UX](http://skyux.developer.blackbaud.com/).  

Feel free to leave feedback by filing an [issue](https://github.com/blackbaud/sky-api-auth-tutorial/issues).
